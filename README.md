# Totemfall

My first Unity game created for a game jam! A top down survival game where you try and survive against waves of enemies. Inspired by the Shaman class in World Of Warcraft.

## Features
- Moveable player with HP
- Able to place down totems on the ground
  - Speed Totem (place to speed up the player)
  - Rooting Totem (roots enemies in intervals)
  - Gravity Well Totem (pulls enemies towards the totem, then explodes for AOE damage)
- Lightning bolt that passively shoots out of the player
- Enemies that run toward the player with random spawn points
- Damage / HP system with damage popups
- Camera controller that shifts based on cursor position 
- An in-game timer
